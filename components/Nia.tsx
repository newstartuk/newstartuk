I'm your AI-assisted guide, here to help you find your way around settling in the UK. I can help with:

• Tips for navigating UK daily life

**Important:** I'm not a real adviser. I can't give immigration, legal, medical, or financial advice. For those, please speak to a qualified professional — your university international student support team is a great place to start.

Here's why:\n\nAs an international student, you've paid the **Immigration Health Surcharge** as part of your visa fee — so you're entitled to full NHS care, including GP services.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Find a GP near you at [nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp)\n2. Check they're accepting new patients\n3. Fill in a **GMS1 registration form** (available at the surgery)\n4. You don't need proof of ID — just your UK address\n\nRegistering early means you're covered when you need medical help.

Compare them at [moneysavingexpert.com](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com) before deciding.\n\nNote: some banks require a branch visit — check this before travelling to the UK!`;

Set these as non-negotiables in your budget.\n• **Student overdrafts** — many UK student accounts offer an interest-free overdraft. Use it carefully as a safety net, not extra income.\n• **Student discounts** — always ask! Most retailers, restaurants, and shops offer a student discount (usually 10–20%). Get a **Totum** card to access these easily.\n• **Free help** — your university will have a free money advice service. Use it!\n\nCheck out the Budget Planner at [moneysavingexpert.com](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com) to build your first budget.`;
