## 🤖 Nia — The NewStart Navigator

Nia is NewStart UK's AI-assisted orientation guide. She helps users understand their checklist tasks, find official sources, and navigate daily UK life.

**Transparency:** Nia is explicitly disclosed as an AI tool — not a real adviser, not affiliated with any government body, not a substitute for professional advice. See [components/Nia.tsx](./components/Nia.tsx) for full implementation.

Nia is **not** designed to answer:
- Immigration or visa-specific questions (→ direct to UKVI/GOV.UK)
- Legal case-specific guidance (→ direct to a qualified solicitor)
- Financial investment decisions (→ direct to a financial adviser)
- Medical diagnosis or treatment (→ direct to NHS 111 or a GP)

---

## 🔐 Data & Privacy

- **Client-side only (current):** All user data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. Nothing is sent to a server.
- **No tracking:** NewStart UK does not use analytics trackers or third-party tracking.
- **Future backend:** When Supabase is connected, data will be stored in Supabase Postgres with Row Level Security policies.

---

## 🔧 Backend Architecture (Roadmap)

The Supabase schema is drafted in [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql). It covers:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | User profiles (extends Supabase Auth) |
| `user_tasks` | Per-user task completion state |
| `guidance_articles` | Guidance content with review status |
| `support_tickets` | User support requests |
| `reminder_log` | Future reminder scheduling (Resend integration) |
| `admin_guidance_versions` | Version history for guidance content |
| `task_audit_log` | Audit trail for task content changes |

RLS (Row Level Security) is configured on all tables. A service role key is required for admin operations in production.
